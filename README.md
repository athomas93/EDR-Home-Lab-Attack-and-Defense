# Home Lab

## Objective
This lab focuses on simulating a real-world cyber attack and testing endpoint detection and response (EDR). Following Eric Capuano's online guide, I used virtual machines to replicate both threat and victim environments. The attack machine will employ 'Sliver' as a command-and-control (C2) framework to target a Windows endpoint, which will be protected by 'LimaCharlie' as the EDR solution.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
